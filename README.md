# FutureForms

*Release 0.18*

FutureForms is an Open-Source object-oriented set of Components, used for
fast and easy development of data entry and update applications. 

FutureForms is a Typescript library, it is easy to extend and customized.
It ensures total segregation of duties Typescript/HTML/CSS/SQL, it
supports continuous integration, and it can scale. 

Interactive vs static business application: FutureForms is primarily made
for interactive applications where you insert, edit and search data in
relational databases.  

FutureForms supports both PostgreSQL and Oracle as database backends.
If you have data that rarely changes, static read-only list in Javascript
is also supported. 

Exposes database as REST (no code). The focus on SQL in order to
facilitate extreme flexibility, is taking into account that all security
related issues must be handled at SQL level. 

FutureForms is developed for internal applications on the intranet.

To try out FutureForms go to the
[install section](#install-futureforms-featured-demo-and-tutorial-installation) .

## Stack

A normal Full-stack development consist of a front-end, a backend and a database.
In FutureForms this is cut down to a front-end, a generic backend and a database.

Here the sketch shows the Javascript application running in the client browser
and then sending SQL statements encapsulated in JSON to the `openrestdb` backend.
The `openrestdb` converts the SQL to the appropriate database driver,
sends the request to the database in the native protocol
and sends the result back to the client in JSON format.

In FutureForms all or mostly all of the business logic
is in the front-end.

Eventually some business logic is written in a
stored procedure in the database.

The backend (web server) is a generic components so none of the
application code is written in here.

Complete network setup with two or more OpenRestDb REST servers
with Nginx as load balancer connecting to a database cluster.

## Security

FutureForms is primarily ment to be used for intranet.
SQL-statements are written in the Javascript application
and then passed through the backend directly to the database.

It is therefore necessary to protect the database with `GRANT`, 
`POLICY` and other security technics.

SQL-statments like `DROP` and `CREATE` can be blacklisted in
`openrestdb` but it is recommended to only `GRANT` necessary
statements in the database itself.

`openrestdb` can be configured to reject known keywords like
`CREATE`, `DROP` and `TRUNCATE` but it recommended to handle
the security in the database with `GRANT`.

### Exploits of a Mom

In a standard full-stack setup you have the risk of a SQL-injection.
With FutureForms any SQL-statements are passed through even
the infamous `"Robert'); DROP TABLE Sudents"` so you have
to protect your database for this kind of statements.

## Install FutureForms featured demo and tutorial installation

This Ansible script will install FutureForms with the extended demo.
This demo will show what a lot of the classes in FutureForms can do.

### Requirements

This script will install a lot of TypeScript package
so it is recommended to run the script in a Ubuntu
server running on a virtual machine (VirtualBox, LXC, VmWare, WSL).
This will make a cleanup easier.

In Ubuntu these packages and their dependencies will be installed:

* Java
* PostgreSQL
* npm
* node-typescript
* unzip

Make the installation easier by not requiring password all the time
add `NOPASSWD:` to the group `%sudo`.
Run the command `visudo`:

```
sudo visudo
```

Change the line with `%sudo` to:

```
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

### Install

Start Ubuntu and install Ansible and Git yourself:

```
sudo apt install ansible
```

Now you are ready to install 
[FutureForms Featured Demo](playbooks/demo/)
with the ansible script.

If you want to develop yourself you should start from the tutorial list:

* [0-empty](playbooks/0-empty/) minimal FutureForms template
* [1-login](playbooks/1-login/) simple database login dialog
* [2-countries](playbooks/2-countries/) one table list & edit
* [3-employees](playbooks/3-employees/) one table list & edit with detailed view
* [4-masterdetail](playbooks/4-masterdetail/) two table display
